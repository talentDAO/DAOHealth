# DAO Health Survey

_Read our write-up on how to use this tool and how it was developed on mirror._

To compute the DAO Health composite score:

1. Take the average response for each question in the survey.
2. Sum the average response for each question.
3. Divide by 250.
4. Multiply by 100.
5. The final number is your DAO Health Score.

This process is adaptable to any way you slice the survey. Just replace step 3 with 'Divide by the total number of questions multiplied by 5', where '5' represents the max scale response on each item. If you do slice the survey, be sure to utilize the same items when comparing measures over time.
