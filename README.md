# DAO Health Survey

_[Read our write-up on how to use the tool and how it was developed on mirror](https://talentdao.mirror.xyz/1rT8KGt6wHzC03UQphG-upuW8HqRX6bP9YfFTtijl0Y)._

_[Pulse Survey write-up coming soon!]_

A composite score can be computed by averaging together all question results [ensure scale normalization and reverse items accounted for]. Composite scores may be valuable comparisons over time. We recommend the large DAO health Survey once per year, with 1-2 pulse surveys conducted in between.
